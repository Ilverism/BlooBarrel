## About BlooBarrel
BlooBarrel provides a simpler way for people with a lower technical ability to download assets from GitHub, and for more technical users to share GitHub content with less technical people.

Simply provide the link to a repo, and BlooBarrel will recommend the best asset(s) to download for your platform.

---
### Basic Site Usage

1. Paste a GitHub repo URL into the *Search for Releases* search bar.
2. Click the üîç search button.
3. Wait a brief moment for any Assets from the latest release to load.
4. View the *Top Recommended Download* or other compatible Assets in the *All Downloads* list.
5. Click the Asset you want to start downloading.

### Other Functionality
- Your *Detected Platform* (used to help recommend Assets) can be changed/overridden using a dropdown menu at the top right.
- You can change how Assets are sorted in the *All Downloads* list by clicking the *Sort By: **Alphabetical*** button.
- After loading a repo, use the *Copy Shareable Link* button to copy a link directly to BlooBarrel, which will load the given repo automatically when opened (e.g., https://ilverism.github.io/BlooBarrel/?owner=electron&repo=electron).
- You can also quickly load a repo's content by appending an entire URL to the BlooBarrel page URL when combined with a hash mark (e.g., https://ilverism.github.io/BlooBarrel/#https://github.com/electron/electron).

### Information Panels
- *Information Panels* can be opened after loading a repo by using a toggle switch that appears at the top right.
- The *Repository Information* panel has the following content:
-- Buttons to open the repo, copy the repo's URL, or open the owner's profile page.
-- The repo's name and 'About' description.
-- A grid of topic badges.
-- A *README* section which first appears as a large glossy button, and can be fully expanded and viewed by clicking on it.
-- The Forks, Watchers, and Stars counts.
- The *Release Information* panel has the following content:
-- Buttons to open the release and copy the release's URL.
-- The release's name, publish date, and creation date
-- A grid of labels
-- A *Release Notes* section which first appears as a large glossy button, and can be fully expanded and viewed by clicking on it.
-- The number of Assets in the release.

---
### Misc. Features

- Supports ‚òÄÔ∏è Light and üåô Dark themes (toggle at the top right).
- The BlooBarrel repo can be opened by clicking the logo at the top left.
- Both the small *Instructions* panel and the whole *Search* panel can be hidden.
- You can jump to a platform's section in the *All Downloads* list by clicking the platform's icon on the left side of the list.

---
### Notes

* Any *Source code* items which normally appear as Assets in GitHub's native release page are not included for download, nor are they counted in the downloadable Assets counter in the *Release Information* panel.
* If no downloadable Assets are available for a repo, a warning message will be displayed instead; the *Information Panels* toggle will still be made available, but only the *Repository Information* panel will be visible.
